      DARA Platform - Deployment Guide
===============================================

This guide will help you fix the deployment error:
"Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/runner/workspace/dist/index.html'"

Choose one of the following deployment methods:

1. Quick Fix (simplest solution)
   - Description: Automatically fixes the directory structure and creates a simplified deployment
   - Command: node run-deployment.js
   - After running: Start with 'node production-server.js'

2. Simple Standalone Deployment (most reliable)
   - Description: Creates a separate deployment folder with everything needed
   - Command: node simple-deploy.js
   - After running: Navigate to './deploy' folder and run 'npm start'

3. Replit Deployment Fix
   - Description: Specifically for fixing Replit deployment issues
   - Command: node replit-deploy-fix.js
   - After running: Use 'node replit-server.js' as your run command in Replit

For manual deployment:

1. Build the application:
   npm run build

2. Fix the directory structure:
   mkdir -p dist/public
   cp -r dist/assets dist/public/ (if assets exists)
   cp dist/index.html dist/public/ (if index.html exists)

3. Create a production server file that serves from dist/public
   Instead of serving from dist directly

4. Start the server:
   node production-server.js
